  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>
    Recently, I stumbled across a video on youtube by Maximillian Schwarzmuller,
    about LLMs. For those of you who aren't familiar, Maximillian Schwarzmuller
    is a pretty well known content creator specializing in web and mobile
    development. I remember watching one of his udemy courses almost 5 years ago
    in react, which gave me a foothold into learning web development, and gave
    me skills to get my first job. It was unexpected to see him on youtube years
    later, talking about the nascent LLMs, but that's what drew me to click on
    his video. (link to it here)
  </p>
  <p>
    In the video, he discusses the recent meteoric rise of LLMs in programming.
    Although he admits they can lead to productivity gains and are useful as
    learning resources, he brings up an interesting, and not commonly stated
    side effect of using these tools for programming. Which is, that as a whole,
    these LLMs overwhelmingly suggest to use certain technologies for web
    development, in particular, NextJS, React, Tailwind, and Express. And as a
    result, this could lead to stagnation in software dev. If everyone uses the
    same technology, and blindly accepts what the LLM says, how will we get new
    developments that improve the developer experience? How will any progress be
    made?
  </p>
  <p>
    I wanted to test this. In order to explore this, I decided to run an
    experiment. If I came up with a list of project ideas for web development,
    what would the LLMs recommend? Would they all give the same technology
    suggestions like SchwarzMuller suggested? Or would they actually be more
    diverse?

  <h1>All Project Ideas</h1>
  <p>
    To test this, I used LLMs, including Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and ChatGPT 4o
    in order to generate a list of project Ideas. To do so, I started with a
    list of different domains (e.g. accounting, foreign languages, recipes,
    etc.), and used Gemini 2.5 to generate a list of 9 project ideas for each
    topic, 3 that were easy and approachable for beginners, 3 that were of
    medium complexity, and 3 advanced topic ideas. The entire list is below.

  <p>
    From there, I used LLMs to give me high level explanations on how to
    implement all of these project ideas. I extracted the tech stacks suggested
    by these different LLMs, and analyzed them to answer the question of just
    how homogenized the answers would be.
