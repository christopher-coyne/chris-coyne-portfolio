Recently, I stumbled across a video on youtube by Maximillian Schwarzmuller, about LLMs. For those of you who aren't familiar, Maximillian Schwarzmuller is a pretty well known content creator specializing in web and mobile development. I remember watching one of his udemy courses almost 5 years ago in react, which gave me a foothold into learning web development, and gave me skills to get my first job. It was unexpected to see him on youtube years later, talking about the nascent LLMs, but that's what drew me to click on his video. <Link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3JbuuEz66I&ab_channel=MaximilianSchwarzm%C3%BCller">his video</Link>.

Although he admits they can lead to productivity gains and are useful as learning
resources, he brings up an interesting, and not commonly stated side effect of using
these tools for programming. Which is, that as a whole, these LLMs overwhelmingly
suggest to use certain technologies for web development, in particular, NextJS, React,
Tailwind, ShadCN, and Express. And as a result, this could lead to stagnation in software
development. If everyone uses the same technology, and blindly accepts what the LLM says,
how will we get new developments that improve the developer experience? How will
any progress be made?

I wanted to test this. In order to explore this, I decided to run an
experiment. If I came up with a list of application applications, and asked LLMs for recommendations on the tech stack,
what would they recommend? Would they all give the same suggestions? Or would they actually be more
diverse?

    To test this, I used LLMs, including Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, and ChatGPT 4o in order to generate a list of project Ideas. To do so, I started with a list of different domains (e.g. accounting, foreign languages, recipes,
    etc.), and used Gemini 2.5 to generate a list of 9 project ideas for each
    topic, 3 that were easy and approachable for beginners, 3 that were of
    medium complexity, and 3 advanced topic ideas. The entire list is below.

    From there, I used LLMs to give me high level explanations on how to
    implement all of these project ideas. I extracted the tech stacks suggested
    by these different LLMs, and analyzed them to answer the question of just
    how homogenized the answers would be.
