## Liminal Spaces

As the subreddit [r/LiminalSpace](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/) defines it, a liminal space is:
> the time between the 'what was' and the 'next.' It is a place of transition, waiting, and not knowing. Liminal space is where all transformation takes place, if we learn to wait and let it form us.

These are some of my favorite ones that I've found, primarily on discord, reddit, and pinterest. I've included credit to the original authors, when possible.
