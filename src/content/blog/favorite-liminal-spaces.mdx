## Liminal Spaces

As the subreddit [r/LiminalSpace](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/) defines it, a liminal space is:
> the time between the 'what was' and the 'next.' It is a place of transition, waiting, and not knowing. Liminal space is where all transformation takes place, if we learn to wait and let it form us.

These are some of my favorite ones that I've found, primarily on discord, reddit, and pinterest. I've included a link to the original authors or post, when possible.

This is not all inclusive. There are some images I've seen in the past, but have been unable to find, even after searching. Hopefully one day they'll reappear.
