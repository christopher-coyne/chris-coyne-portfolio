Recently, like a lot of developers, I decided to make a blog and portfolio site. In doing research for the design and features I wanted, I came across some excellent examples of developer portfolios made by others. I'm just going to post them here for reference in the future, and maybe give some ideas to others.

In thinking about the design I wanted, I prioritized a design that was simple, lightweight, and quick to develop and iterate on. The following were great examples of this:

<div class="divider"></div>
<Section class="flex flex-col gap-4 md:gap-8">
<ExternalHeaderLink title="Astro Nano and Astro Sphere" link="/" />

These 2 designs by Mark Horn were my primary influences when creating my own portfolio. They are also great examples of how to use Astro, a static site generator, which I also used to build my own portfolio. What I like about them is how the simplicity is present not only in the designs, but in the code itself. Astro nano uses html and tailwind CSS, with no javascript frameworks. Making it perfect if you need a lightweight blog

</Section>
<ExternalHeaderLink title="Nono Ma" link="/" />

In addition to having a wicked clean design, Nono has some great content as well. He is a creative technologist researcher, and hosts his podcast as well as many of his sketches on his personal site.

This is such a small touch, but I love how his pic rotates on hover. That little animation brings so much life to the site.

<ExternalHeaderLink title="Brittany Chiang" link="/" />

I bet many people aren't surprised Brittany is on here. I think this is actually the fifth iteration of her portfolio, and the effort shows. This is probably the most polished portfolio on this list, her experience as a designer is clear as well. The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is how it uses NextJs. I feel like given the simplicity of the site, a simpler tool could have been used as well. But overall, its a great reference with a bit more pizzazz than the others on the list.

<ExternalHeaderLink title="Flavien Bonvin" link="/" />

Another inspiration for my current design. He also details how he made it here:

<div class="divider"></div>
<ExternalHeaderLink title="Craftz.dog" link="/" />

Love the neon accent colors on this one. Plus that dog animation at the top is awesome! He also has an interesting note taking project:
