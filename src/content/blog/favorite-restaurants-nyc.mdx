## Favorite NYC restaurants

Here are some of my favorite places in NYC. They aren't the absolute best ones I've eaten at, but ones that stuck out to me in some way, and that I frequently find myself thinking about. Either very unique and memorable food, or restaurants that became highlights in my rotation at some point.

### Talkin' Tacos

The best restaurant I've eaten at in Washington Heights. All of their tacos are incredible and their burritos are a great deal for the amount of food. Really reasonable prices as well, slightly more than chipotle for the same amount of food, but of much higher quality. My personal recommendations are for the southwest chicken tacos, carribean tacos, and of course the birria. This was the first place I've tried birria tacos and they did not disappoint.

Also recommend the drinks - the different flavored lemonades and horchatas were quite tasty and very refreshing. Wish I had more of a chance to try their desserts, but I live all the way across the city now.

### Upside Pizza

Personally I don't eat pizza that often. Upside pizza near Columbia is certainly not the best pizza in Manhattan, but it's well done and feels a solid cut above the average slice I've had in the city. Would recommend the sausage + peppers and spicy vodka pizzas.
