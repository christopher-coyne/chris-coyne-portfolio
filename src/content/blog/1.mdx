I'm not much of a gamer. In fact, until pretty recently my Steam library only had 2 games. Bioshock infinite, which I have probably never even played 1/10th of the way through, and Uberstrike, a random, free FPS that I toyed around a bit with in high school. Something about games in general, I never quite enjoyed, was the pressure. Even with pretty easy games, whenever I played them, it always felt as though there was a sense of urgency. To kill an enemy, deliver item A to point B... whatever it was, there was always something to do, an objective to complete. And even if logically I knew there was no penalty for standing around and doing nothing, it never felt like that. These games never felt like real worlds to me, they always seemed to be vehicles for the gameplay itself, to actually sit around and take in the atmosphere was not part of their intent, and they impressed upon me that I never had the time for them. That's why I generally didn't play games.

But for the first time in years, I downloaded Steam again, reset my password, and loaded up another game to check out. This one was not a first person shooter though, it was a relatively obscure indie title that had come out only a couple of years prior.

Babbdi.

My interest was first piqued after watching Jacob Geller's incredible video essay - "Games that Don't fake the space". Babbdi, as well as all of the games he covered, were like these miniature worlds, full of spaces of intrigue, and places of introspection and awe, and menace. The focus of his essay was not the actual game play or mechanics of these games, but how the use of space, and the player's transition from one area to another creates unique experiences, little capsules of introspection between the gameplay. It was during this essay that Babbdi caught my eye. The art style is downright grotesque, and the desolate city seemed like a great place to explore for its own sake. I barely even knew the plot of the game itself, the only impressions I had were from the limited gameplay on Jacob's video. But that was enough to hook me in.

For those of you who have not played this game, Babbdi has a straightforward plot. You spawn in the middle of this concrete mess of a city, and your mission is to find a train ticket, go to the train station, and leave town. Sounds simple, and it is - beating this game will probably take you less than an hour. Simply getting a ticket and going to the station does sound easy, but your adventure through the city is impeded by a labyrinth of buildings, random staircases, stagnant brown water, and meandering streets and overlooks. As well as a general lack of hints - the map is confusing, the NPCs arent of much help, and even instructions that are given by the NPCs are vague and leave you without direction. And maybe thats the point - the goal of the game is to explore the city, not beat it as quickly as possible.

From the screenshots, its quite clear this is a weird game. And I am certainly not the only one to comment that. The comments I have read from other players range from horror, to confusion, to discomfort at the visuals. I mean, look at these characters, something is definitely not right in the city of Babbdi.

And yeah, the obvious thing to point to when trying to say that "Babbdi is a weird game" is the ghoulish NPCs, and the brutalist, confusing architecture of the city. But there is also a more complex reason behind why Babbdi is so offputting to people who play it. One that has to do with a rather topical theme - AI generated media.

Some of these instances of AI generation are plain to see, and so out in the open that they are apparent early in the game. The instructions to the train station look right out of the text of early AI generated images. You can kind of make out the intention of the text, it seems like it's imitating the phrase "train station" - but it's clearly missing the mark.

Same with the text telling you how to get to the travel agent. Hell, even the game's menu itself, what does "plame" even mean? It looks exactly like AI generated text - it resembles a real word (conjunction of "play" and "game", I imagine), but a human would never make such a bizarre typo. Just browsing some images of midjourney renders though, we can notice similar AI generated text:

(images of these things... - from midjourney)

Theres even instances of AI generated images in the game itself. A TV nestled in one of the concrete buildings plays photos of Macron eating peas. On the edge of the map, only accessible if you get a special propeller item, you can see framed pictures of AI artwork.

And this shouldnt be a shock - its not just these examples. The whole vibe of the city seems AI generated.

A huge part of why something seems to be AI generated is the confusion of form with function. Back in the early days of AI generated images, i.e. over 2 years ago, this was much more apparent. But the most famous and referenced example is with hands. The AI understands the "form" of hands, to a decent degree. It knows there are fingers, and joints, but it doesn't really understand "what" a hand is, and as a result, you get these monstrosities.

(some pics of AI generated hands)

It understands the hand as a colleciton of shapes and colors. It doesn't understand the physics of joints, how fingers can be manipulated, and the purpose of hands in relation to humans. When AI generated images were more prevalent, this was exemplified in the meme "name one object in this photo"

(solar sands vid + image)

It almost breaks my brain to look at this. These shapes and colors and textures are familiar, and LOOK real, but what kind of function do they have here? This is an intelligence that understands HOW things look, but not WHY things are the way they are

(original pic of the AI generated image)

this is not dissimilar from cargo cults, (background on them here) also example from Ian mccollum - reproducing guns, but reproducing text or things onto those guns with clearly no understanding of how it works.

This creates an eeriness in that example. "name one object in this photo" is almost brain breaking. Other incongruencies in AI generated images can also be unnerving, or distracting at the least.

I believe this eeriness is also present in Babbdi. Those examples I gave earlier - of approximations of human concepts, but in a way that is familiar, but offputting in how unusual it is, and how it doesnt line up with our conceptions. They LOOK like words, but arent really like that. There are stairs and roads, but in nonsensical ways, not designed for humans.

It goes deeper than that. take a look at the tools themselves. A bat letting you jump higher by hitting the ground? Being able to fly with some kind of weird propeller contraption? Scaling buildings with a pickaxe? Once again, this is nonsensical to humans. But from an AI perspective, this makes more sense - this is a use of tools in a way where the form is identifiable, but it doesnt line up really with the function of what these things are.

(examples of asking older AIs "can i climb up a wall with a pickaxe", or "can i fly with a leafblower...")

In fact, this is present in the title itself. I mentioned earlier how "babbdi" kind of sounds like "babble". well, what is babble? its children imitating human speech, without understanding the deeper meaning behind it. Anyone can do this, but its most obvious in AI generated artwork, and in the strange architecture and gameplay of babbdi itself. The developers are blatant in their references to AI generation, even putting in AI generated art into the game, and admitting to using AI generated textures(?):

Macron eating peas
ai art on the boat

The reason the use of AI generated artwork works so well in Babbdi, is that the whole city and quest you are on has this strange, AI generated feeling to it. Like the entire game was constructed by an intelligence mimicking human actions, without understanding the complex reasons behind them.

So, what does this mean for the game? ------

I've heard many people make similar observations as above, explaining the strangeness of the game and city. And on top of that, they use similar ways of describing it: "surreal"

I agree, this is certainly surreal. But in a darker more sinister way, or at least it appears that way to the player. The atmosphere is gloomy, these "people" look like ghouls, you're stuck in some city that looks like eastern europe, this is an offputting and deeply weird experience.

(sidenote... what is the deal with surreal pieces of art and trains?)

Or maybe, it just appears that way to us.

A lot of the weirdness and creepiness of Babbdi comes from the environment, and how alien and hostile it seems. But in the city itself - what really is there that is depressing?

Sure, a sick woman has died, and there are boarded up windows, gun on a table, and people are dancing in front of a bonfire.

But on the other hand, we get touching moments of emotion, humanity even. A listless girl gazing off into the distance, waiting for a man on a motorbike to take her away. An old woman with groceries walking home, a man sitting on the concrete, enjoying the sunshine, a man remarking on how the person in front of him has grown up over time. And while these interactions are quite strange, are they bleak? Are they depressing? Are the characters of Babbdi grim and sullen, and resigned to their fate? Or are these just scenes from a city, unlike our own?

Nothing can hurt you in Babbdi, there's no way to die. The one death in the game is a sick woman who succumbs, a tragedy, but present in any city. Pretty much everyone who plays Babbdi describes it as grim and unsettling, but it seems like a lot of the discomfort is just that, and not a serious threat. Babbdi is a city unlike our own, influence by this artificial intelligence, but is it inherently worse? Or is it just different.

This leaves one final question - why are there no tickets out of Babbdi?

All of the characters you encounter say there are no tickets left. The travel agent himself repeats the same phrase. You only end up getting one from the dead woman. Why? What happened to the tickets?

Could it be, as some suspect, that out of this depressing ghost town, every citizen who could leave, already has? That you are figuratively trapped in this depressing city?
